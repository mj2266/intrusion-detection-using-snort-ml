# intrusion-detection-using-snort-ml
- Snort IDS is an open-source network security tool. It can search and match rules
with network traffic data in order to detect attacks and generate an alert. One
of the greatest challenges of todayâ€™s rule-based network intrusion detection system
(NIDS) is the largest value of its false-positive rate which makes the rule-based NIDS
system unreliable. Our main goal is to deliver an intrusion detection system with
lower false-positive rate
- Implemented different ML classification algorithms for intrusion detection
using SNORT
- Demonstrated and evaluation of the live working of our modified NIDS by
performing attacks from Kali Linux Machine to Ubuntu Machine
- Integrated ML model with SNORT for Intrusion Detection
